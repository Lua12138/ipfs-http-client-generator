# ipfs-http-client-generator

This project is to automatically generate the Retroift-based API interface based on the [IPFS HTTP API documentation][1].

The automatically generated interface is not fully usable and still requires manual tuning, especially for the return value types, which are not structured in the documentation and therefore cannot be automatically generated with reliable types.

However, most interfaces can be used directly.
